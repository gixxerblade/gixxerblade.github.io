# CS WEEK ONE

## 3 goals I want to take away from CS:

1. I want to be able to think like a programmer to help solve problems in an efficient way, on my own.
2. I want to understand objects. I understand objects to a certain extent but I have problems with inheritance and polymorphism.
3. I want to understand recursion. I can't wrap my head around it. 

## Background of technical experience & math:

B.S. Information Technology 2019

### Technical classes:

* Operating Systems
* Software Systems Analysis and Design
* Securing Mobile and Cloud Computing Environments
* Database Management Systems
* Computer Security
* Computer Systems Architecture
* Circuit Theory
* Object Oriented Programming (a long time ago!)

### Math Classes

* Discrete Structures (not super mathy)
* Pre-calculus Algebra
* College Algebra
  
> In my own words, I believe Computer Science is the study of how computer systems interact with software systems to produce a desired outcome.
