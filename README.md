# CS WEEK ONE

## 3 goals I want to take away from CS:

1. I want to be able to think like a programmer to help solve problems in an efficient way, on my own.
2. I want to understand objects. I understand objects to a certain extent but I have problems with inheritance and polymorphism.
3. I want to understand recursion. I can't wrap my head around it. 

## Background of technical experience & math:

#### B.S. Information Technology 2019

### Technical classes:

* Operating Systems
* Software Systems Analysis and Design
* Securing Mobile and Cloud Computing Environments
* Database Management Systems
* Computer Security
* Computer Systems Architecture
* Circuit Theory
* Object Oriented Programming (a long time ago!)

### Math Classes

* Discrete Structures (not super mathy)
* Pre-calculus Algebra
* College Algebra
  
> In my own words, I believe Computer Science is the study of how computer systems interact with software systems to produce a desired outcome.

##### Intro to algorithims.

* Find the fastest 3 horses - There are 25 horses among which you need to find out the fastest 3 horses. You can conduct race among at most 5 to find out their relative speed. At no point you can find out the actual speed of the horse in a race. Find out how many races are required to get the top 3 horses.
* Circular array
